This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates a DLL hijacking attack. Running this code can potentially harm your system or compromise your security. (it probably doesnt even work but yeah)

What is DLL Hijacking?
---------------------

DLL hijacking is a type of attack where an attacker replaces a legitimate DLL file with a malicious one, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system.

About this Repository
--------------------

This Python script generates a hijacked DLL by loading an original DLL, extracting its export symbols, and creating a new DLL that replaces the original exports with a user-provided hijack code. The script outputs the hijacked DLL code in C and an export definition file, allowing the user to compile and use the hijacked DLL.
